**Homework**

Homework is worth 60% of the course grade. I'm fairly flexible about what homework problems you do (you'll have a choice) and just when you hand them in, as long as you ultimately hand them in by the end of the semester. (Sooner is better, and no penalty is invokedâ€”I just won't give out solution sets until the last person hands a given set in.) Each problem set is due two weeks after it is assigned.
